# In MongoDB, aggregation pipelines are used to process and transform data 
  from a collection — similar to how you’d use SQL’s GROUP BY, JOIN, or 
  WHERE clauses.

# An aggregation pipeline is a series of stages, where each stage takes input 
  from the previous one and outputs processed data.

  Each stage can:

    * Filter documents ($match)
    * Group data ($group)
    * Sort results ($sort)
    * Join collections ($lookup)

  Add or reshape fields ($project)
  Calculate averages, sums, counts, etc.
  Think of it like a data processing pipeline 
  — data flows through multiple steps to produce a final result.

# EXAMPLE:

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },       // Filter
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }, // Group & Sum
  { $sort: { total: -1 } }                   // Sort by total descending
]);



🔹 Why we need it:

Aggregation pipelines are needed because:

They handle complex queries efficiently — like analytics, filtering, and transformations in one go.

Reduce workload on your app — MongoDB does the heavy data processing, not your backend code.

Improve performance — pipelines are optimized internally for large datasets.

Enable advanced operations — such as joins ($lookup), grouping ($group), and computed fields ($addFields).
